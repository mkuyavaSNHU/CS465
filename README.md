**Architecture**
The web application will be developed with a hybrid architecture and both sites will interact with a REST API built in MongoDB, Express and Node.js. The administrative site will be an Angular single-page application (SPA) and the customer facing site will be built using the MEAN stack. The MEAN stack uses MongoDB which is the document database, Express(.js) is the web application framework which allows the use of Model View Controller (MVC) routing patterns, the front-end is Angular JavaScript, and Node.js is the server environment. The MVC architectural pattern will be used to separate the application into three major main components, the model, the view, and the controller; utilizing the MVC architectural pattern makes the application easier to manage and update. 

**Functionality** 
JSON is a data transmission format. JavaScript is a programming language. JSON is used in frontend and backend development by passing HTTP requests containing JSON bodies.
Refactoring the API endpoints to have authentication was one of the most important updates made to the application. Data security is a top priority. 

**Testing**
Utilizing programs such as Postman or Studio T3 to verify that the requests were processed successfully and checking the Mongo data base directly through the PowerShell. 

**Reflection** 
Full Stack Development is an important skill, I learned a lot about client/server development and  REST APIs.
